# Discrete Mathematics Notes

Concise, course-oriented notes for Discrete Mathematics from Webster University ([Discrete_Mathematics.tex](Discrete_Mathematics.tex) and [Discrete_Mathematics.pdf](Discrete_Mathematics.pdf)).
- Class: MATH 2410 (from the document header)
- Format: Compact 2-column PDF built with LaTeX
- Scope: sets, functions, counting, logic, proofs, graphs.

## Additional Sheets
- CSCI 2824 Discrete Structures (wich is an equivalent classe from the University Of Colorado Boulder): [Discrete_Structures_CUB.tex](Discrete_Structures_CUB.tex) and [Discrete_Structures_CUB.pdf](Discrete_Structures_CUB.pdf) are included in this folder cheat sheet.

## Contents Overview
- Naive Set Theory: notation, operations, cardinality, Cantor, Schroeder–Bernstein, well-ordering
- Functions: domain/codomain, injective/surjective/bijective, images and inverse images
- Counting: additive/multiplicative principles, permutations, combinations, binomial coefficient, binomial theorem
- Symbolic Logic: connectives, quantifiers, equivalences, properties, De Morgan's laws
- Proof Techniques: direct, contrapositive, contradiction, cases, (strong) induction; rules of inference
- Graph Theory: definitions, degree/handshaking lemma, special graphs (trees, forests, planar), Euler's formula, coloring, Euler/Hamiltonian paths and cycles, Dirac & Ore theorems

## How to Use
- Quick reference: equations and definitions are compact; use the textbooks for deeper understanding.
- Visuals: some sections use TikZ for figures (graphs, planarity sketches).
- Extend: add margin notes or examples in new subsections to keep the main sheet concise.
