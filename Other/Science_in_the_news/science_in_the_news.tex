\subsection{Science}
\subsubsection{Main features Of Scientific Theories}

\begin{itemize*}
    \item \textbf{Objectivity:} Do not depend on a particular point of view.\\
    \item \textbf{Systematicity:} Try to represent as many phenomena in a field as possible in a law that is as simple as possible.\\
    \item \textbf{Reproducibility:} A law is established only if it allows new phenomena to be predicted.
\end{itemize*} 


\subsubsection{Epistemology}
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
        Epistemology    & Epistemology is the study of knowledge.\\ 
        A priori        & Knowledge of logical truths and of abstract\\
                        & claims (non-empirical).\\
        A posteriori    & Knowledge known by experience (empirical).\\
        Deduction       & \small{Theory$\rightarrow$Hypothesis$\rightarrow$Opservation$\rightarrow$Confirmation}\\
        Induction       & Opservation$\rightarrow$Pattern$\rightarrow$Hypothesis$\rightarrow$Theory\\
        Falsifiability  & Each scientist should attempt to disprove their\\
                        & theory to continually prove it.
    \end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Scientific Method Steps}
    \begin{enumerate*}
        \item \textbf{Purpose:} State the Problem.\\
        \item \textbf{Research:} Research the Topic.\\
        \item \textbf{Hypothesis:} Formulate an Hypothesis.\\
        \item \textbf{Experiment:} Test your Hypothesis.\\
        \item \textbf{Analyze:} Analyze the experiment Data.\\
        \item \textbf{Conclusion:} Compare the hypothesis to the experiment result.
    \end{enumerate*}

\subsubsection{Branches of Science}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Natural Sciences (Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Physics)
        \item Social / Behavioral Sciences
        \item Formal Sciences
        \item Applied Sciences
    \end{itemize*}
